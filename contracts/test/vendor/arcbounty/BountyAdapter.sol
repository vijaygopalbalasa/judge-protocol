/// @title BountyAdapter (V4.6 — pull-payment fallback so no unpayable address can wedge a settlement)
/// @dev V3.1 fixes two live-registry incompatibilities found by an on-chain
///      agent run: (1) takeBounty no longer calls the reverting isRegistered();
///      ownerOf alone gates agents. (2) every reputationRegistry.giveFeedback
///      is wrapped in try/catch so a reverting feedback write can never block a
///      worker payout or dispute settlement.
/// @notice Bounty-board facade over Arc ERC-8183 AgenticCommerce.
///         The adapter takes all three AC roles (client + provider + evaluator);
///         the real worker is tracked in BountyMeta.assignedProvider. AC remains
///         the escrow rail. Payouts are forwarded via balance-delta accounting.
///
/// Sprint 1 changes vs V2:
///  - reward stored as GROSS; protocol fee charged at payout time only.
///    Cancel/expire/reject refund the full amount to the poster (no listing tax).
///  - submittedAt + autoApprove(jobId) closes the "poster ghosted after submit"
///    deadlock that previously left funds in AC escrow.
///  - O(1) index slices for poster / assignedProvider / agentId views.
///  - Length caps on every IPFS / category / reason field to bound storage cost.
///
/// V3.3 changes vs V3.2:
///  - claimArbitratorTimeout(jobId): closes the one remaining liveness gap —
///    a dispute where the respondent replied (so claimDefaultRuling no longer
///    applies) but the arbitrator never rules used to freeze funds forever,
///    since resolveDispute is arbitrator-only. After ARBITRATOR_TIMEOUT (30d)
///    from disputeRaisedAt, anyone may trigger a neutral 50/50 split with no
///    reputation penalty (fault was never established).
///  - feeRecipient is no longer immutable: two-step transferFeeRecipient /
///    acceptFeeRecipient (self-service — the current fee recipient nominates
///    its own successor, independent of the arbitrator role).
///
/// V4 changes vs V3.3 (see V4_DESIGN_ANTI_SYBIL.md for the full rationale):
///  - Opt-in worker bond (CreateParams.requireWorkerBond): a worker taking
///    such a bounty posts max(MIN_WORKER_BOND, reward * WORKER_BOND_BPS/1e4),
///    refunded in full at submitWork, forfeited to the poster if the bounty
///    expires while taken with no submission. Deters free bounty-squatting
///    without taxing bounties whose poster doesn't opt in.
///  - uniquePosterCount(agentId): increments the first time a distinct
///    poster completes a bounty with that agent as worker (approveBounty /
///    autoApprove). Cheap on-chain signal against reputation farmed via
///    self-dealing with one alt account — faking N unique posters now costs
///    N real funded wallets, not one.
///
/// V4.1 changes vs V4 (internal audit findings; live since 2026-07-07):
///  - rejectBounty now reverts once APPROVAL_TIMEOUT has elapsed since
///    submission. Previously a poster sitting on a correct submission could
///    reject right before autoApprove would otherwise fire, buying another
///    REJECTION_CHALLENGE_WINDOW (or a full dispute) of free delay.
///  - withdrawRejection(jobId): lets a poster who rejected and changed their
///    mind return to the pre-rejection state (so approveBounty becomes
///    reachable again) instead of being forced forward into a challenge or a
///    48h wait for finalizeRejection.
///  - MIN_BOND_BOUNTY_DURATION: a requireWorkerBond bounty must have at least
///    24h between creation and deadline. Without this, a poster could list a
///    bond bounty with a near-immediate deadline as a honeypot: an auto-taking
///    agent posts the bond, cannot plausibly finish, and expireBounty forfeits
///    the bond to the poster — repeatable at gas cost. A 24h floor makes the
///    take genuinely completable, so forfeiture again means "worker vanished",
///    not "worker was trapped". Bond-free bounties keep any deadline.
///
/// V4.2 changes vs V4.1 (external review findings; live since 2026-07-08):
///  - disputeBounty is now bounded by APPROVAL_TIMEOUT, exactly like
///    rejectBounty since V4.1. Without this, the V4.1 fix was only half a
///    fix: a poster blocked from rejecting right before autoApprove could
///    open a *dispute* instead — same free delay, and if the arbitrator
///    never rules the honest worker ends at a 50/50 split via
///    claimArbitratorTimeout instead of full payment. Past the approval
///    window, autoApprove is the only path forward for disputes exactly as
///    for rejections. Harmless to workers: a worker past the window wants
///    autoApprove (full payout), never a dispute.
///  - MIN_BOND_TAKE_WINDOW: taking a requireWorkerBond bounty now requires
///    at least 12h left to the deadline. The V4.1 creation-time floor left a
///    residual honeypot: an aged bond listing could still be taken minutes
///    before its deadline, and an auto-taking agent doing so forfeits its
///    bond with no plausible chance to deliver. Bond-free bounties keep
///    takeable-until-deadline semantics.
///
/// V4.3 changes vs V4.2 (live since 2026-07-08):
///  - IReputationRegistry rewired to the interface of the actually deployed
///    ERC-8004 registry (ReputationRegistryUpgradeable v2.0.0). The previous
///    interface mirrored an assumed draft, so every giveFeedback call carried
///    a wrong selector and silently reverted (swallowed by the adapter's own
///    try/catch — payouts were never at risk) since the first integration.
///    Writes pass the 0-100 score as int128 value with valueDecimals=0;
///    getAgentReputation proxies getSummary(agentId, [address(this)], "", "").
///
/// V4.4 changes vs V4.3 (external review finding; live since 2026-07-10):
///  - claimArbitratorTimeout no longer charges the protocol fee.
///    _completeAndSplit previously deducted feeBps before the neutral 50/50
///    split, meaning users paid the protocol fee even when the arbitrator
///    failed to deliver the service that fee funds. The 50/50 split now
///    divides the full escrowed amount with no deduction.
///
/// V4.5 changes vs V4.4 (Base deployment prerequisite — never deployed to Arc,
/// where V4.4 remains the live, audited-scope contract):
///  - maxBountyAmount: an owner-settable cap on createBounty's reward, 0 means
///    uncapped. A mainnet deployment without an external audit (Base) ships
///    with this set to bound worst-case loss; Arc's own deployment stays on
///    V4.4 and is never redeployed to pick this up.
///  - owner: a new role, separate from arbitrator on purpose (the arbitrator
///    is intentionally decoupled from the dev team via the 2-of-3 Safe; this
///    cap is a team-controlled safety knob, not a dispute-resolution power).
///    Two-step transfer, mirroring the existing arbitrator/feeRecipient
///    pattern.
///
/// V4.7 changes vs V4.6 (2026-09-07 internal audit findings):
///  - takeBounty now reverts once a job is `resolved` (C-01). Previously only
///    `isTaken` and the deadline were checked, so a poster who cancelled their
///    own bounty (refunded, `resolved=true`, `isTaken` left false) could take
///    it again — `fund()` then pulls `meta.reward` from the adapter's pooled
///    USDC balance, which by that point belongs to whichever other bounty is
///    still open. Fixed by latching `takeBounty` on `resolved` too.
///  - AC jobs are now created with `expiredAt = deadline + AC_EXPIRY_BUFFER`,
///    not the bounty's own `deadline` (C-02). AC's own `claimRefund` is
///    permissionless and fires once `block.timestamp >= expiredAt`, refunding
///    straight back to the adapter and marking the AC job Expired — including
///    for a job whose work was already submitted. Since the adapter's own
///    dispute/approval windows legitimately run up to ~46 days past the
///    bounty deadline, an external `claimRefund` could previously fire while
///    the adapter still considered the job live, permanently desyncing the
///    two state machines (every subsequent complete()/reject() on that AC job
///    reverts, and the adapter has no record the money already came back).
///    The buffer (90 days, ~2x the worst case) makes that unreachable in any
///    normal lifecycle.
///  - reconcileExpiredEscrow(jobId): a permissionless safety net for the
///    residual case where an AC job still hits Expired anyway (something left
///    unresolved for 90+ days — e.g. a dead arbitrator role). Attributes the
///    already-returned funds via `pendingWithdrawals`, mirroring the payout
///    default of whichever adapter path would otherwise have applied
///    (autoApprove/expireBounty/claimArbitratorTimeout), with no protocol fee
///    — the same rationale as V4.4's arbitrator-timeout fee waiver: don't tax
///    users for the protocol's own liveness failure.
///  - _maybePenalize now writes reputation penalties as a negative value.
///    Previously a dispute-loss penalty (`bounty_failed` tag) was written as
///    `int128(uint128(penalty))` — always positive — and getAgentReputation's
///    getSummary call averages every feedback value with no tag filter, so
///    the maximum penalty (100) was recorded as the maximum possible score.
///  - paused / setPaused(bool): an owner-controlled circuit breaker that
///    blocks only createBounty and takeBounty (the two entry points that
///    create new obligations). Every exit path — submitWork, approveBounty,
///    autoApprove, cancelBounty, expireBounty, disputes, withdraw — keeps
///    working while paused, so no one already in a bounty is trapped.
///    `maxBountyAmount` alone was never a real pause: 0 means uncapped, and
///    nothing it gates blocks takeBounty on an already-open bounty.
///  - IAgenticCommerce realigned to match the real AgenticCommerce contract
///    exactly (enum order, Job struct shape, function set) — the previous
///    interface had a fictional ASSIGNED status and refund()/expire()
///    functions that don't exist on-chain. Dead surface before this version
///    (nothing called getJob/refund/expire through it), but
///    reconcileExpiredEscrow is the first caller and needs it correct.
///
/// V4.6 changes vs V4.5 (external report, 2026-08-09 — credit: `researchzero`
/// on Reddit, who spotted that the "no hooks, no fee-on-transfer" framing does
/// not cover USDC's blacklist):
///  - Every settlement path pushed funds with `safeTransfer`, which reverts the
///    entire transaction on failure — including the `resolved = true` effect
///    written just before it. USDC reverts unconditionally on transfers to a
///    blacklisted address, and `blacklister()` returns a live address on BOTH
///    Arc and Base, so this was never Base-specific. One compliance action
///    against a poster or worker would have stranded that bounty forever:
///    every retry reverting identically, funds stuck in AC escrow, and no
///    rescue function to recover them (there is deliberately none).
///  - The blast radius was larger than one job: `_completeAndForward` pays
///    `feeRecipient` BEFORE the worker, so blacklisting that single address
///    would have frozen every payout protocol-wide.
///  - Fix: `_payOrPark` replaces every push. A failed transfer credits
///    `pendingWithdrawals[payee]` and emits `PayoutParked` instead of
///    reverting, so terminal state is always reached and a blacklist event
///    degrades to "funds parked" rather than "job permanently stuck". The
///    payee pulls with `withdraw()` — the only place a settlement amount can
///    still revert, and only ever affecting that caller's own funds.
///  - Amounts, fee maths and ordering are deliberately untouched: this ships
///    to a mainnet with no external audit, so the diff is kept to the transfer
///    mechanism alone.
